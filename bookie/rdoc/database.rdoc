=Database Tables

==users
Holds all users who have executed jobs

If a user changes groups, a new entry is created with the same username but a different group.
The old entry is retained so that older records have access to it.

===Fields
- name (varchar): the user's name
- group (foreign key): the user's group

==groups
Holds all groups that have executed jobs

===Fields
- name(varchar): the group name

==systems
Holds all systems that have reported jobs

If a system's specifications are changed, it must be marked as decommissioned and allowed to create a new entry with the updated specifications. There may only be one active system (with a non-NULL end_time) for each hostname at a time.

===Fields
- name (varchar): the system's name (i.e. hostname)
- system_type (foreign key): the system's type
- start_time (time): the time at which the system became active
- end_time (time): the time at which the system was decommissioned (may be NULL)
- cores (integer): the number of cores on the system
- memory (integer): the memory (in KB) that the system contains

==system_types
Holds all system types

===Fields
- name (varchar): the name of the type
- memory_stat_type (integer): a code representing the type of memory statistic that the machine enters in the database (i.e. maximum, average, etc.)

==jobs
Holds all jobs that have been reported

===Fields
- user (foreign key): the user who executed the job
- system (foreign key): the system on which the job was executed
- start_time (time): the time that the job started
- end_time (time): the time that the job ended
- wall_time (integer): the number of seconds that the job executed
  - With the start_time and end_time fields, this is somewhat redundant, but it could be useful for queries.
- cpu_time (integer): the number of seconds of CPU time used by the job
- memory (integer): the memory (in KB) used by the job
  - The exact meaning is dependent on the system type's memory_stat_type field
- exit_code (integer): the job's exit code
