First priority:
- Update docs.
- Update executables.

Later:
- Optimize summarization stuff.
- Connect to users DB or LDAP?

Optimization:
- Use bulk inserts?

Cleanup:
- Remove find_or_create methods.
- Make sure all source files have the required "require"s
- Fix memory specification issue
- Replace <tt> tags in docs with <code>?
- Determine whether printing job details is still necessary.

Testing:
- Validate uniqueness?
- Unit test uniqueness constraints?
- Set up guard-rspec gem for testing?

Testing cleanup:
- Use File.open blocks in config tests to ensure proper file closure.
- Use "let" in RSpect tests?
- Replace 3600 with 2.hours, etc.
- Also clear out other "magic" numbers.
- Replace by_* methods with a "find_all_by()" method? (or just "where"...)
- Split some tests up.
- Replace Mocha with rspec-mocks?
- Rename "snapshot" directory?
- Ensure that RSpec tests use "::method" for class methods.
- Make units more independent.
  - Mock database objects?
- Test executables somehow? (and integrate with Travis CI)!
- Use FactoryGirl to generate test objects?

Expansion:
- Use concurrency control?

Data consistency considerations:
If a user is deleted, how to we handle that? Mark the user's processes with an "unknown" UID?
