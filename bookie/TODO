First priority:
- Update docs.
- Update executables.

Later:
- Optimize summarization stuff.
- Connect to users DB or LDAP?

Testing:
- Test executables somehow? (and integrate with Travis CI)!
- Use FactoryGirl to generate test objects?

Optimization:
- Use bulk inserts?
- Wrap send/summarize operations in a transaction

Cleanup:
- Remove find_or_create methods.
- Replace by_* methods with a "find_all_by()" method? (or just "where"...)
- Use "let" in RSpect tests?
- Replace 3600 with 2.hours, etc.
- Also clear out other "magic" numbers.
- Split some tests up.
- Make sure all source files have the required "require"s
- Replace Mocha with rspec-mocks?
- Fix memory specification issue
- Replace <tt> tags in docs with <code>?
- Rename "snapshot" directory?
- Ensure that RSpec tests use "::method" for class methods.
- Determine whether printing job details is still necessary.

Expansion:
- Use concurrency control?

Testing:
- Validate uniqueness?
- Unit test uniqueness constraints?
- Make units more independent.
- Set up guard-rspec gem for testing?

Data consistency considerations:
If a user is deleted, how to we handle that? Mark the user's processes with an "unknown" UID?
