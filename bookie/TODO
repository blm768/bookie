First priority:
- Add user/group IDs
- Remove concurrency control
- Optimize summarization stuff.
- Filter out 0-time jobs (use Ruby config w/ block?)

Later:
- Connect to users DB or LDAP?

Testing:
- Test executables somehow? (and integrate with Travis CI!

Use bulk inserts?
Replace by_* methods with a "find_all_by()" method? (or just "where"...)
Allow configuration of date boundary to midnight in local time zone?
Make sure all source files have the required "require"s
Use "let" in RSpect tests?
Replace 3600 with 2.hours, etc.
Also clear out other "magic" numbers.
Split some tests up.
Validate uniqueness?
Unit test uniqueness constraints?
Use optimistic concurrency control?
Make units more independent.
Make unit test success more independent.
Fix memory specification issue
Specify dependency versions
Replace Mocha with rspec-mocks? 

Data consistency considerations:
If a user is deleted, how to we handle that? Mark the user's processes with an "unknown" UID?
